**IP Sniffer built using Rust**

This is a CLI tool built using Rust that displays a list of available ports for a given IP address

Commands:
-h, -help: Help command. Provides a description of available commands.
-j: Start sniffing the ports. It requires two arguments: num_threads (number of threads to use for searching) and ipaddr (the IP address to search on)
